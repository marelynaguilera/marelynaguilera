# Hi, I'm Maria

I'm software engineer and I have been in the software world for about 15 years. I started as a developer, but I have held roles of Scrum master, and Project manager, and more recently, Agile tester. I am passionate about quality and creating products that make life easier for users.

I am convinced that we can all develop a quality mindset and that doesnâ€™t only mean to deliver a product without bugs, itâ€™s to deliver exactly what the customer needs, keeping everything as simple as possible.

This space is to share learnings (code) I've prepared for demos and presentations for the testing community <a target="_blank" href="https://linktr.ee/under_test/">Under Test :mag:</a> using <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io/">webdriverIO</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>.

I also think that there is power in communities, so I actively participate in <a  href="https://www.venezolanasintech.org/">Venezolanas In Tech</a>, Agile Ecuador and <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-agile-ecuador">Women in Agile Ecuador</a>, sharing experiences and knowledge while I feed off the community. Also, I colaborated with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hack_women">IT Skills for Women</a>, a bootcamp for women in Latam.

Find me around the web ðŸŒŽ <a target="_blank" href="https://iterative.me">https://iterative.me</a> where I write my thoughts and my learnings on how to deliver better software through collaboration and communication, and, of course, better techniques (manual and automated) with the understanding that the responsibility for quality lies with the entire team and at all levels of our software development process.
